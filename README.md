## Installation Steps

### 1. Download and Setup Files

1. Download all the system files
2. Create the following directory structure on your web server:

```
clinic_management/
├── index.php                 # Public website homepage
├── booking.php               # Online booking page
├── config/
│   └── database.php          # Database configuration
├── admin/
│   ├── login.php            # Admin login page
│   ├── dashboard.php        # Admin dashboard
│   ├── logout.php           # Logout functionality
│   └── [other admin files]
└── uploads/                  # Directory for file uploads
    ├── doctors/             # Doctor photos
    └── encounters/          # Encounter files
```

### 2. Database Setup

1. Create a MySQL database named `clinic_management`
2. Import the database schema by running the SQL commands from the database schema file
3. The schema will create all necessary tables and insert default data

### 3. Configuration

1. Edit `config/database.php` and update the database connection settings:

```php
$db_config = [
    'host' => 'localhost',        # Your MySQL host
    'dbname' => 'clinic_management',
    'username' => 'your_username', # Your MySQL username
    'password' => 'your_password', # Your MySQL password
    'charset' => 'utf8mb4'
];
```

2. Create the uploads directory and set proper permissions:

```bash
mkdir uploads
mkdir uploads/doctors
mkdir uploads/encounters
chmod 755 uploads
chmod 755 uploads/doctors
chmod 755 uploads/encounters
```

### 4. Web Server Configuration

#### Apache (.htaccess)
Create a `.htaccess` file in the root directory:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^admin/([^/]+)/?$ admin/$1.php [L,QSA]

# Security headers
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"

# Prevent access to sensitive files
<Files "*.log">
    Deny from all
</Files>
<Files "config.php">
    Deny from all
</Files>
```

#### Nginx
Add to your site configuration:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}

location /admin {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /admin/index.php?$query_string;
}

location ~ /config/ {
    deny all;
    return 404;
}
```

### 5. Initial Setup

1. Access your website at `http://yoursite.com`
2. Access the admin panel at `http://yoursite.com/admin/login.php`
3. Default admin credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Change the default password immediately after first login!**

## Configuration Guide

### 1. System Settings
After logging in as administrator, configure:

- Clinic name and address
- Contact information
- Email settings for notifications
- Invoice header and formatting
- Logo upload

### 2. Doctor Management
- Add doctor profiles with photos
- Set specializations
- Manage doctor accounts and permissions

### 3. Services and Pricing

### 4. Email Configuration
For email notifications to work, configure SMTP settings in the system settings:

- SMTP Port (usually 587 for TLS)
- Email username and password
- Enable "Less secure app access" for Gmail or use App Passwords

## Security Considerations

### 1. Admin Access URL
- The admin login should be accessed via a non-obvious URL
- Consider using a subdomain like `admin.yourclinic.com`
- Or use a custom path like `/clinic-admin-2024/`

### 2. File Permissions
Set appropriate file permissions:

```bash
# Directories
find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

# PHP files
find . -name "*.php" -exec chmod 644 {} \;

# Upload directories (writable)
chmod 755 uploads/
chmod 755 uploads/doctors/
chmod 755 uploads/encounters/
```

### 3. Database Security
- Use strong database passwords
- Create a dedicated database user with minimal privileges
- Enable MySQL SSL if possible
- Regular database backups

### 4. SSL Certificate
- Install an SSL certificate for HTTPS
- Force HTTPS redirects
- Update all internal links to use HTTPS

## Customization

### 1. Styling
- Modify CSS in the `<style>` sections of each PHP file
- Colors, fonts, and layout can be customized
- The system uses a consistent color scheme based on `#667eea` and `#764ba2`

### 2. Branding

1. **Database Connection Error**
